# Bridge Fees

There are currently no fees for users when bridging between xDai and Ethereum. Fees are subsidized by the validators. In future iterations, a small fee may be introduced to cover expenses incurred when sending transactions from xDai to Ethereum. This will be determined by [xDai Bridge Governanance Processes](https://www.xdaichain.com/about-xdai/faqs/bridges-xdai-bridge-and-omnibridge#what-is-the-bridge-governance-board).
